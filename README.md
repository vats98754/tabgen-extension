# tabgen-extension
I learn new concepts or deepen existing knowledge with a sequence of tabs - I would like a shortcut of generating and managing tabs (open/close and group tabs/windows), so I'm making a browser extension that generates the most relevant sequence of tabs. I will use this tool for my own learning of new concepts.
